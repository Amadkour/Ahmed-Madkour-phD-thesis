\section{Summary}
\label{sec:6_summary}
This study presents a novel framework for incremental learning in data streams, with a focus on heterogeneous transfer learning. The approach effectively integrates concept drift detection via the ADWIN algorithm, eigenvectors for knowledge transfer, and ensemble classifiers. Extensive experiments on benchmark, real-world, and synthetic datasets validate the framework's efficacy in adapting to evolving data patterns. The use of Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) optimizes classifier performance, enhancing predictive performance and robustness. The framework excels in handling heterogeneous multi-source domains, providing high adaptability, efficiency, and scalability to real-time data streams while maintaining reliable and relevant performance.
