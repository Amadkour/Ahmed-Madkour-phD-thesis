        \item $\pmb{Q_2}$. What is the impact of reducing overlapping classes stream on the performance of ML models in non-stationary environment?
        \item $\pmb{Q_3}$.How does the emergence of new classes in data streams affect the stability and performance of ML models?
        \item $\pmb{Q_4}$. how to employee concept drift to solve the emerging new classes problem?
        \item $\pmb{Q_5}$. How does the Heterogeneous sources in data streams affect the stability and performance of Transfer Learning Technique?
        \item $\pmb{Q_6}$. What approaches or techniques can be employed in heterogeneous transfer learning to facilitate knowledge transfer across diverse sources and domains?
