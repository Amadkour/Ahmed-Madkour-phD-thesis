\section{Thesis Objectives}
\label{sec:1_introduction_objectives}
The thesis objectives for our research stems from the imperative need to address the following key motivations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective 1}. Thandling Imbalanced Multiclass Drifted Data and overlapping classes streams.
    \item \textbf{Objective 2}. Addressing Emerging New Classes in Incremental Streams via Concept Drift and K-means Techniques.
    \item \textbf{Objective 3}. Addressing Heterogeneous Transfer Learning Problem in data streams via Concept Drift and Eigenvector Techniques.
\end{itemize}
