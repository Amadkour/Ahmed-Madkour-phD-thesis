\label{sec:1_introduction_organizations}
The structure of the remainder of this thesis dissertation is outlined below.
\begin{description}	
	\item \textbf{Chapter~\ref{cha:2_background}} reviews background about concept drift, concept drift types, concept drift components, adapting types.  
	
	\item \textbf{Chapter~\ref{cha:3_State-of-the-art}} reviews state-of-the-art  concept drift, classifier ensemble selection, imbalanced data streams, Streams with Emerging New Classes (SENC), and transfer learning.  
	
	\item \textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:4_Imbalanced_Multiclass}
	} presents our first proposal to build an effective proposed approch for  handling Imbalanced Multi-class Drifted Data streams.
	
	\item \textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:4_Imbalanced_Multiclass}} provides our second proposal to adressing emerging new classes in incremental streams via concept drift techniques. 
	
	\item \textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:4_Imbalanced_Multiclass}} presents our third proposal to addressing heterogeneous transfer learning problem  in incremental streams via concept drift techniques.
	
	\item \textbf{Chapter~\ref{cha:7_Conclusions}} revisits the main goal and specific objectives posted earlier. In this chapter, we summarise the main contributions of this thesis and outline possible future research.
