\section{Imbalanced data Streams}
\label{sec:3_3_imbalanced}
In imbalanced data classification, three main approaches have been identified \cite{yin2022graph}, with this study emphasizing the first category, which addresses imbalanced data streams through sampling methods, particularly oversampling \cite{ren2023grouping}. This technique creates synthetic instances to achieve balanced class distributions \cite{nitesh2002smote, han2005borderline, bunkhumpornpat2009safe, maciejewski2011local}. Imbalances can arise in both binary and multi-class settings, with this research concentrating on multi-class oversampling strategies.

To address multi-class imbalances, Multi-Label SMOTE (MLSMOTE) \cite{charte2015mlsmote} extends SMOTE to multi-class learning by generating synthetic examples for minority class labels and ensuring their proper assignment. A more recent technique, Multi-Label Synthetic Oversampling based on Local Label Imbalance (MLSOL) \cite{yin2022graph}, improves upon MLSMOTE by targeting local imbalances within multi-class classification. MLSOL uses distinct sampling strategies for each label, offering superior performance in classification accuracy and other metrics. It generates synthetic samples from minority class instances in a restricted neighborhood, improving computational efficiency and reducing overfitting, making it a promising technique that outperforms MLSMOTE in several areas.
