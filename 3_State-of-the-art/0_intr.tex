\label{cha:3_State-of-the-art}

This chapter provides an in-depth review of recent advancements in stream classification, addressing key challenges in dynamic data environments, such as concept drift, imbalanced multiclass scenarios, class overlap, ensemble selection, new class emergence, and transfer learning. Section \ref{sec:3_1_concept_drift} explores methodologies for real-time concept drift detection and adaptation to maintain classification accuracy. Section \ref{sec:3_2_ensemble} focuses on dynamic classifier ensemble selection strategies to enhance performance in evolving data streams. Section \ref{sec:3_3_imbalanced} tackles imbalanced multiclass problems, discussing oversampling techniques to balance minority classes in drifted streams. Section \ref{sec:3_4_emergence} examines methods for integrating new classes into existing systems to improve adaptability, while Section \ref{sec:3_5_transfer_learning} highlights the role of transfer learning in leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Section \ref{sec:3_6_comparsion} provides a comparative analysis of recent works, evaluating contributions, limitations, and research gaps, and Section \ref{sec:3_7_remartks} concludes the chapter by outlining critical challenges and directions for future research.
