    First and foremost, I give my deep thanks to Allah for giving me the opportunity and the strength to accomplish this work.



    I would like to thank my supervisors Dr. Hatem Mohammed and Dr. Amgad Monir for their help and support during my work for creating a very inspiring research environment. They have been helpful with background information and have continually encouraged me and helped me with comments on my work. They always had time to discuss new ideas and give feedback on early ideas and research problems.
    
    I would like to thank my family who was a constant source of rising and supporting my spirit. Thanks go out especially to my father, my mother, my wife, and my brothers for support and encouragement.
    
    Finally, special thanks to my faculty, department, and my colleagues.
