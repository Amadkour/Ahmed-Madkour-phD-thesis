\section{Summary}
\label{sec:4_summary}
This study presents an innovative framework combining oversampling techniques, concept drift detection, and Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) to address multiclass imbalanced data streams. Extensive experimentation on benchmark, real-world, and synthetic datasets validates its effectiveness in adapting to evolving class distributions and maintaining high performance. Key features include advanced oversampling to tackle minority class challenges, the use of KNN to avoid overlapping instances, and DES for optimal classifier selection. The approach is distinguished by its adaptability, scalability, and ability to dynamically update models in real-time, ensuring consistent performance and relevance in non-stationary environments.
