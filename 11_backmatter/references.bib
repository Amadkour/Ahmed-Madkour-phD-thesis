  abstract = {Machine learning studies automatic algorithms that improve themselves through experience. It is widely used for analyzing and extracting value from large biomedical data sets, or ``big biomedical data,'' advancing biomedical research, and improving healthcare. Before a machine learning model is trained, the user of a machine learning software tool typically must manually select a machine learning algorithm and set one or more model parameters termed hyper-parameters. The algorithm and hyper-parameter values used can greatly impact the resulting model's performance, but their selection requires special expertise as well as many labor-intensive manual iterations. To make machine learning accessible to layman users with limited computing expertise, computer science researchers have proposed various automatic selection methods for algorithms and/or hyper-parameter values for a given supervised machine learning problem. This paper reviews these methods, identifies several of their limitations in the big biomedical data environment, and provides preliminary thoughts on how to address these limitations. These findings establish a foundation for future research on automatically selecting algorithms and hyper-parameter values for analyzing big biomedical data.},

@article{Xia2016,
  abstract  = {Accurate and timely traffic flow prediction is crucial to proactive traffic management and control in data-driven intelligent transportation systems (D2ITS), which has attracted great research interest in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a Spatial–Temporal Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor model, named STW-KNN, in a general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling on a Hadoop platform, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of short-term traffic flow forecasting. More specifically, STW-KNN considers the spatial–temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features, to optimize the search mechanisms containing state vector, proximity measure, prediction function, and K selection. Furthermore, STW-KNN is implemented on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform with the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm, for parallel prediction of traffic flow in real time. Finally, with extensive experiments on real-world big taxi trajectory data, STW-KNN is compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models including conventional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and C4.5. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to existing models on accuracy by decreasing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value more than 11.59{\%} only in time domain and even achieves 89.71{\%} accuracy improvement with the MAPEs of between 3.34{\%} and 6.00{\%} in both space and time domains, and also significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of short-term traffic flow forecasting over existing approaches.},

  abstract  = {As the demands on urban transportation networks grow rapidly, problems of network design have attracted a great deal of interest because of the need to effectively handle urban transport planning using information technology. A bi-level continuous network design model is proposed in this paper to address the optimal road capacity expansion of existing links. Based on the fact that every origin–destination demand is random and affected by traffic travel information, the network is subject to relatively minimal day-to-day events of stochastic link capacity variations. Therefore, the primary objective is to maximize the reliability of the total travel time, while the lower level model, utilizing the behaviors of stochastic route choice, is aimed at reducing drivers' travel time uncertainty through traffic information provided by advanced traveler information systems. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to solve the suggested model, and a numerical example using the Sioux Falls network is provided. The computation results show that travel time reliability is improved by system optimization using traffic information.},

In this study, a novel kernel-based machine learning method, the Gaussian processes (GPs) model, was proposed to perform short-term traffic flow forecasting. This GP model was evaluated and compared with SVMs and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models based on four sets of traffic volume data collected from three interstate highways in Seattle, Washington.

In this paper, loop counter data are used to develop models that can predict traffic flow for several different prediction intervals into the future. In depth exploratory data analysis and statistical testing is performed to obtain good quality informative features. Several feature sets were compared by using different machine learning methods: Ridge Regression, SVR and Random Forests. The results show that in order to obtain good prediction results thorough feature extraction is just as or even more important than learning method selection. Good features enables us to use less complex methods, which run faster, are more reliable and easier to maintain.

In many experimental studies, the lack of the required properties for a proper application of parametric procedures–independence, normality, and homoscedasticity–yields to nonparametric ones the task of performing a rigorous comparison among algorithms. In this paper, we will discuss the basics and give a survey of a complete set of nonparametric procedures developed to perform both pairwise and multiple comparisons, for multi-problem analysis. The test problems of the CEC'2005 special session on real parameter optimization will help to illustrate the use of the tests throughout this tutorial, analyzing the results of a set of well-known evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms.

In this paper we present a new method which exploits both meta-level information ac-quired in past experiments and active testing, an algorithm selection strategy. Active testing attempts to iteratively identify an algorithm whose performance will most likely exceed the performance of previously tried algorithms. The novel method described in this paper uses tests on smaller data sample to rank the most promising candidates, thus opti-mizing the schedule of experiments to be carried out. The experimental results show that this approach leads to considerably faster algorithm selection.},

Through extensive experiments with real-world data, we found that a large number of sensors, usually over 100, are relevant to the prediction task at one sensor, which means wide area correlation and high dimensionality of the data. This paper investigates the first time into the feature selection problem for traffic congestion prediction. By applying feature selection, the data dimensionality can be reduced remarkably while the performance remains the same. Besides, a new traffic jam probability scoring method is proposed to solve the high-dimensional computation into many one-dimensional probabilities and its combination.},

  abstract  = {Accurate urban traffic flow forecasting is critical to intelligent transportation system developments and implementations, thus, it has been one of the most important issues in the research on road traffic congestion. Due to complex nonlinear data pattern of the urban traffic flow, there are many kinds of traffic flow forecasting techniques in literature, thus, it is difficult to make a general conclusion which forecasting technique is superior to others. Recently, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. This investigation presents a SVR traffic flow forecasting model which employs the hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing algorithm (GA-SA) to determine its suitable parameter combination. Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow data from northern Taiwan is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SVRGA-SA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), Holt–Winters (HW) and seasonal Holt–Winters (SHW) models. Therefore, the SVRGA-SA model is a promising alternative for forecasting traffic flow.},

  abstract  = {To improve the quality of travel time information provided to motorists, there is a need to move away from point forecasts of travel time. Specifically, techniques are needed which predict the range of travel times which motorists may experience. This paper focuses on travel time prediction on motorways and evaluates three models for predicting the travel time range in real time as well as up to 1h ahead. The first model, termed lane by lane tracing, relies on speed data from each lane to replicate the trajectories of relatively slow and relatively fast vehicles on the basis of speed differences across the lanes. The second model is based on the relationship between mean travel time (estimated using a neural network model) and driver-to-driver travel time variability. The results provide insight into the relative merits of the proposed techniques and confirm that they provide a basis for reliable travel time range prediction in the short-term prediction context (up to 1h ahead).},

Roland Ewald analyzes and discusses existing approaches to solve the algorithm selection problem in the context of simulation. He introduces a framework for automatic simulation algorithm selection and describes its integration into the open-source modelling and simulation framework James II. Its selection mechanisms are able to cope with three situations: no prior knowledge is available, the impact of problem features on simulator performance is unknown, and a relationship between problem features and algorithm performance can be established empirically. The author concludes with an experimental evaluation of the developed methods.},

  abstract  = {Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) is one of the functional areas of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and it aims at providing real time traffic information to the travellers for making better travel decisions. This information would be most effective if provided to travellers during or before the start of their trip. Therefore, accurate prediction models are required in ATIS for conveying reliable information about the future state of traffic. Different methods used for the prediction of traffic parameters include historic averaging, regression analysis, Kalman filtering, time series analysis, machine learning, etc. The objective of this research is to explore the use of automated sensor data and data driven techniques for traffic state prediction under Indian traffic conditions. Travel time and traffic density (as an indicator of congestion) are used commonly to inform users about the state of a traffic system. However, these two parameters are spatial in nature and direct measurement from field is difficult. Therefore, estimation of these parameters from location based data is a challenge in many of the ITS implementations. The present study addresses the problem of estimation of traffic density with the help of location based sensors which are capable of measuring parameters such as volume and Time Mean Speed (TMS). Machine learning techniques namely, k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are selected as the estimation and prediction tool in this study, based on acceptable performance of the same in earlier studies.},

  abstract  = {Travel time is an important performance measure for transportation systems, and dissemination of travel time information can help travelers make reliable travel decisions such as route choice or departure time. Since the traffic data collected in real time reflects the past or current conditions on the roadway, a predictive travel time methodology should be used to obtain the information to be disseminated. However, an important part of the literature either uses instantaneous travel time assumption, and sums the travel time of roadway segments at the starting time of the trip, or uses statistical forecasting algorithms to predict the future travel time. This study benefits from the available traffic flow fundamentals (e.g. shockwave analysis and bottleneck identification), and makes use of both historical and real time traffic information to provide travel time prediction. The methodological framework of this approach sequentially includes a bottleneck identification algorithm, clustering of traffic data in traffic regimes with similar characteristics, development of stochastic congestion maps for clustered data and an online congestion search algorithm, which combines historical data analysis and real-time data to predict experienced travel times at the starting time of the trip. The experimental results based on the loop detector data on Californian freeways indicate that the proposed method provides promising travel time predictions under varying traffic conditions.},

We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work that attacks these issues separately. We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA's standard distribution, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection and hyperparameter optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance.},

  abstract  = {None of numerous existing traffic flow forecasting models focus on work zones. Work zone events create conditions that are different from both normal operating conditions and incident conditions. In this paper, four models were developed for forecasting traffic flow for planned work zone events. The four models are random forest, regression tree, multilayer feedforward neural network, and nonparametric regression. Both long-term and short-term traffic flow forecasting applications were investigated. Long-term forecast involves forecasting 24 h in advance using historical traffic data, and short-term forecasts involves forecasting 1 h and 45, 30, and 15 min in advance using real-time temporal and spatial traffic data. Models were evaluated using data from work zone events on two types of roadways, a freeway, i.e., I-270, and a signalized arterial, i.e., MO-141, in St. Louis, MO, USA. The results showed that the random forest model yielded the most accurate long-term and short-term work zone traffic flow forecasts. For freeway data, the most influential variables were the latest interval's look-back traffic flows at the upstream, downstream, and current locations. For arterial data, the most influential variables were the traffic flows from the three look-back intervals at the current location only.},

  abstract  = {The advent of Big Data era has transformed the outlook of numerous fields in science and engineering. The transportation arena also has great expectations of taking the advantage of Big Data enabled by the popularization of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this study, the viability of a proactive real-time traffic monitoring strategy evaluating operation and safety simultaneously was explored. The objective is to improve the system performance of urban expressways by reducing congestion and crash risk. In particular, Microwave Vehicle Detection System (MVDS) deployed on an expressway network in Orlando was utilized to achieve the objectives. The system consisting of 275 detectors covers 75 miles of the expressway network, with average spacing less than 1 mile. Comprehensive traffic flow parameters per lane are continuously archived on one-minute interval basis. The scale of the network, dense deployment of detection system, richness of information and continuous collection turn MVDS as the ideal source of Big Data. It was found that congestion on urban expressways was highly localized and time-specific. As expected, the morning and evening peak hours were the most congested time periods. The results of congestion evaluation encouraged real-time safety analysis to unveil the effects of traffic dynamics on crash occurrence. Data mining (random forest) and Bayesian inference techniques were implemented in real-time crash prediction models. The identified effects, both indirect (peak hour, higher volume and lower speed upstream of crash locations) and direct (higher congestion index downstream to crash locations) congestion indicators confirmed the significant impact of congestion on rear-end crash likelihood. As a response, reliability analysis was introduced to determine the appropriate time to trigger safety warnings according to the congestion intensity. Findings of this paper demonstrate the importance to jointly monitor and improve traffic operation and safety. The Big Data generated by the ITS systems is worth further exploration to bring all their full potential for more proactive traffic management.},

  abstract  = {Massive datasets of Floating Car Data (FCD) are collected and thereafter processed to estimate and predict traffic conditions. In the framework of short-term traffic forecasting, machine learning techniques have become very popular. However, the big datasets available today contain for the most part easily predictable data, that are data observed during recurrent conditions. Integration of different machine learning techniques with traffic engineering notions must contribute to obtain new transportation-oriented data-driven methods. In this paper we address traffic dynamics estimation by using individual FCD in order to develop an integrative framework able to recognize and select the suitable method for traffic forecasting. Taking into account the spatial distributions of individual FCD positions we retrieve a new spatial-based criterion for the integration of models.},

  abstract  = {Traffic forecasting is a well-known strategy that supports road users and decision-makers to plan their movements on the roads and to improve the management of traffic, respectively. Current data availability and growing computational capacities have increased the use of machine learning methods to tackle traffic forecasting, which is mostly modelled as a supervised regression problem. Despite the broad range of machine learning algorithms, there are no baselines to determine what are the most suitable methods and their hyper-parameters configurations to approach the different traffic forecasting regression problems reported in the literature. In machine learning, this is known as the model selection problem, and although automated machine learning methods have proved successful dealing with this problem in other areas, it has hardly been explored in traffic forecasting. In this work, we go deeply into the benefits of automated machine learning in the aforementioned field. To this end, we use Auto-WEKA, a well-known AutoML method, on a subset of families of traffic forecasting regression problems characterised by having loop detectors, as traffic data source, and scales of predictions focused on the point and the road segment levels within freeway and urban environments. The experiments include data from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System and the Madrid City Council. The results show that AutoML methods can provide competitive results for TF with low human intervention.},

In addition to being accurate, a pedestrian positioning system must be mobile, cheap, and lightweight. Many approaches have been explored. In this paper, we take the advantage of sensors integrated in a smartphone and their capabilities to develop and compare two low-cost, hands-free, and handheld indoor navigation systems. The first one relies on embedded vision (smartphone camera), while the second option is based on low-cost smartphone inertial sensors (magnetometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope) to provide a relative position of the pedestrian. The two associated algorithms are computationally lightweight, since their implementations take into account the restricted resources of the smartphone. In the experiment conducted, we evaluate and compare the accuracy and repeatability of the two positioning methods for different indoor paths. The results obtained demonstrate that the vision-based localization system outperforms the inertial sensor-based positioning system.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a radio frequency (RF)-based location tracking system that improves its performance by eliminating the shadowing caused by the human body of the user being tracked. The presence of such a user will influence the RF signal paths between a body-worn node and the receiving nodes. This influence will vary with the user's location and orientation and, as a result, will deteriorate the performance regarding location tracking. By using multiple mobile nodes, placed on different parts of a human body, we exploit the fact that the combination of multiple measured signal strengths will show less variation caused by the user's body. Another method is to compensate explicitly for the influence of the body by using the user's orientation toward the fixed infrastructure nodes. Both approaches can be independently combined and reduce the influence caused by body shadowing, hereby improving the tracking accuracy. The overall system performance is extensively verified on a building-wide testbed for sensor experiments. The results show a significant improvement in tracking accuracy. The total improvement in mean accuracy is 38.1\% when using three mobile nodes instead of one and simultaneously compensating for the user's orientation.},

Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},

  abstract   = {This article explores properties and suitability of mobile and wearable platforms for continuous activity recognition and monitoring. Mobile phones have become generic computing platforms, and even though they might not always be with the user, they are increasingly easy to develop for and have an unmatched variety of on-board sensors. Wearable units in contrast tend to be purpose-built, and require a certain degree of user adaptation, but they are increasingly used to do continuous sensing. We explore the trade-offs for both device types in a study that compares their sensor data and that explicitly examines how often these devices are being worn by the user. To this end, we have recorded a dataset from 51 participants, who were given a wrist-worn sensor and an app to be used on their Smartphone for two weeks continuously, totalling 638 days (or over 15300 hours) of wearable and mobile data. Results confirm findings of previous studies from North America and show that Smartphones are on average being on their user less than 23\% of the time, mostly during working hours. Just as noteworthy is the high variance in Smartphone use (in carrying, interacting with, and charging the phone) among participants.},

  doi       = {10.1109/BIOROB.2016.7523790},
  abstract  = {The advent of embedded sensors and their low cost integration in handheld devices (e.g. smartphones) are making them increasingly aware of the human location and context. There have been attempts to extract certain gait features (e.g. step length, step frequency etc.) based on data recorded from handheld devices. However, these attempts have been mostly inspired from observations in biomechanics. Hence, there is a profound need to study the modeling of human walking gait cycle while taking into account the different device carrying modes. It is hypothesized that the presence of handheld device in one hand can alter the step level symmetry of human walking gait cycle without affecting the stride level symmetry. The aim of this paper is to present a model of human walking gait cycle in different device carrying modes over a stride, which is based on parametric optimization technique used in robotics motion generation and the results of a preliminary experimentation conducted using motion capture technology. Both simulation and pilot experiments confirm that the presence of a small mass in one hand can affect the step level symmetry of the human walking gait which constitutes the novel outcome of this paper. Overall, the model successfully captures human walking features and can stand useful for the enhancement of existing pedestrian navigation algorithms with handheld devices for an increased autonomy of elderly people and pedestrian's mobility in general.},

  abstract   = {Healthy walking is characterized by pronounced arm swing and axial rotation. Aging effects on gait speed, stride length and stride time variability have been previously reported, however, less is known about aging effects on arm swing and axial rotation and their relationship to age-associated gait changes during usual walking and during more challenging conditions like dual tasking. Sixty healthy adults between the ages of 30–77 were included in this study designed to address this gap. Lightweight body fixed sensors were placed on each wrist and lower back. Participants walked under 3 walking conditions each of 1 minute: 1) comfortable speed, 2) walking while serially subtracting 3’s (Dual Task), 3) walking at fast speed. Aging effects on arm swing amplitude, range, symmetry, jerk and axial rotation amplitude and jerk were compared between decades of age (30–40; 41–50; 51–60; 61–77 years). As expected, older adults walked slower (p = 0.03) and with increased stride variability (p = 0.02). Arm swing amplitude decreased with age under all conditions (p = 0.04). In the oldest group, arm swing decreased during dual task and increased during the fast walking condition (p{\textless}0.0001). Similarly, arm swing asymmetry increased during the dual task in the older groups (p{\textless}0.004), but not in the younger groups (p = 0.67). Significant differences between groups and within conditions were observed in arm swing jerk (p{\textless}0.02), axial rotation amplitude (p{\textless}0.02) and axial jerk (p{\textless}0.001). Gait speed, arm swing amplitude of the dominant arm, arm swing asymmetry and axial rotation jerk were all independent predictors of age in a multivariate model. These findings suggest that the effects of gait speed and dual tasking on arm swing and axial rotation during walking are altered among healthy older adults. Follow-up work is needed to examine if these effects contribute to reduced stability in aging.},

  abstract = {Humans walk bipedally, and thus, it is unclear why they swing their arms. In this paper, we will review the mechanisms and functions of arm swinging in human gait.
              First, we discuss the potential advantages of having swinging arms. Second, we go into the detail on the debate whether arm swing is arising actively or passively, where we will conclude that while a large part of arm swinging is mechanically passive, there is an active contribution of muscles (i.e. an activity that is not merely caused by stretch reflexes). Third, we describe the possible function of the active muscular contribution to arm swinging in normal gait, and discuss the possibility that a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) generates this activity. Fourth, we discuss examples from pathological cases, in which arm swinging is affected. Moreover, using the ideas presented, we suggest ways in which arm swing may be used as a therapeutic aid.
              We conclude that (1) arm swing should be seen as an integral part of human bipedal gait, arising mostly from passive movements, which are stabilized by active muscle control, which mostly originates from locomotor circuits in the central nervous system (2) arm swinging during normal bipedal gait most likely serves to reduce energy expenditure and (3) arm swinging may be of therapeutic value.},

  abstract  = {Location based services can improve the quality of patient care and increase the efficiency of the healthcare systems. Among the different technologies that provide indoor positioning, inertial sensors based pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) is one of the more cost-effective solutions, but its performance is limited by drift problems. Regarding the heading drift, some heuristics make use of the building's dominant directions in order to reduce this problem. In this paper, we enhance the method known as improved heuristic drift elimination (iHDE) to be implemented in a Step-and-Heading (SHS) based PDR system, that allows to place the inertial sensors in almost any location of the user's body. Particularly, wrist-worn sensors will be used. Tests on synthetically generated and real data show that the iHDE method can be used in a SHS-based PDR without losing its heading drift reduction capability.},

The relations between the various representations of the attitude and the kinematic equations are given completely. The transformations connecting different attitude covariance representations are presented for the case where the errors in the attitude are sufficiently small that they can be represented by an infinitesimal rotation. Examples of the use of each representation are presented and some historical notes provided.},

The proposed algorithm can refine the results of existing indoor localization systems and match them with the map, using loose coupling between the existing localization system and the proposed map matching technique. The purpose of this research is to investigate the efficiency of using the CRF technique in offline map matching problems for different scenarios and parameters. The algorithm was applied to several real and simulated trajectories of different lengths. The results were then refined and matched with the map using the CRF algorithm.},

  abstract = {Positioning accurately and safely a train is nowadays a great challenge. That includes currently available railway sensors and new candidate sensors for data fusion. Global Navigation Satellite System and Inertial Measurement Unit sensors arise as prominent technologies to incorporate in railways. Although satellite-based train localization tests can be found in the scientific literature, there are no common criteria to evaluate the performance of the positioning achieved. In this paper, a series of criteria is defined and justified in order to be able to evaluate the most recent and relevant works related to train positioning. The results of this comparative analysis are gathered in tables, where the criteria defined are applied to the works compiled. According to the results obtained, a research gap in safety related applications is found. It is concluded that the economic viability of given solutions should be explored, so as to design an on-board train-integrated positioning system.},

Therefore, the challenge to be tackled in this paper is to develop a dependents’ cooperative location network over which tutors could monitor the dependents’ positions in real time, giving them more freedom to safely roam within public spaces. Not only in open spaces such as crowded parks or streets, but also inside buildings such as city malls, museums or nursing homes. The aim of this paper is twofold, to create a cooperative and dynamic network of tutors over which monitor the position of their dependents by means of standardized technologies, and to understand how the physical environment could influence handicapped people's activities by means of behavioral analysis in public spaces.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose an enhancement to our previous Conditional Random Field (CRF) based map matching algorithm in order to make the map matched trajectory smoother and more feasible. The existing algorithm uses one feature, which is the distance with the input coordinate, and has the problem of non-smooth output trajectory. In this work we propose adding a new semantic layer to the map model that depends on the behavioral areas of walking, and to use that information in the map matching algorithm to enhance the smoothness of the output trajectory. The common walking lines of pedestrians will be determined and this behavioral information will be added as a feature to the CRF algorithm. A test version of the new algorithm is applied on a few examples and the results show smoother and more accurate map matched trajectories.},

  abstract = {By tracking the path of the center of pressure (COP) during the stance phase, the balance and pattern of progression can be determined. The path of COP is frequently used in clinical practice, although it is not quantified. In this study, an F-scan pressure sensitive insole system was used to quantify the path of COP. The COP of initial contact and the average during the stance phase corresponded to the center of the heel and to the center of the total plantar surface, respectively. The COP displacement corresponded to 83\% of foot contact length and 18\% of forefoot contact width. When the longitudinal axis of the insole was plotted as the Y-axis and the transverse axis of the insole as X-axis, the slopes of the COP coordinates during stance phase was 6° inward. Velocities of the COP during each functional rocker action were even and 22–27 cm/s. The changes of quantified COP parameters according to the biomechanical alteration of the foot were confirmed by high-heeled gait.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe and quantify centre of pressure (CoP) displacement during walking in 12 unilateral trans-femoral amputees who had worn a prosthesis for at least 10 years. All subjects wore the same type of prosthesis and seven healthy subjects acted as controls. The CoP was acquired by an F-scan system and the displacements along the longitudinal axis of the foot versus time were quantified. An asymmetry of both temporal and spatial parameters of CoP patterns occurred between the sound and the prosthetic foot. The double support time and the time during which the CoP remained in the heel and mid-foot region were longer for the prosthetic limb. Conversely, the stance phase was longer for the sound limb, as was the time spent by the CoP in the forefoot. There was a redistribution of the time during which the CoP remained within the different zones of the sound foot with respect to the normal feet of the control subjects. The asymmetry seen in trans-femoral amputee stance is due not only to an abnormal spatio-temporal distribution of the CoP under the prosthetic leg, but also to a modification of the spatio-temporal distribution of the CoP under the sound foot compared to the normal foot. We conclude that an adaptation occurs in the control of the stance phase on the sound side during amputee gait.},

  abstract = {Walking is often modeled as an inverted pendulum system in which the center of mass vaults over the rigid stance limb. Running is modeled as a simple spring-mass system in which the center of mass bounces along on the compliant stance limb. In these models, differences in stance-limb behavior lead to nearly opposite patterns of vertical movements of the center of mass in the two gaits. Our goal was to quantify the importance of stance-limb behavior and other factors in determining the trajectory of the center of mass during walking and running. We collected kinematic and force platform data during human walking and running. Virtual stance-limb compression (i.e. reduction in the distance between the point of foot-ground contact and the center of mass during the first half of the stance phase) was only 26\% lower for walking (0.091 m) than for running (0.123 m) at speeds near the gait transition speed. In spite of this relatively small difference, the center of mass moved upwards by 0.031 m during the first half of the stance phase during walking and moved downwards by 0.073 m during the first half of the stance phase during running. The most important reason for this difference was that the stance limb swept through a larger angle during walking (30.4 degrees) than during running (19.2 degrees). We conclude that stance-limb touchdown angle and virtual stance-limb compression both play important roles in determining the trajectory of the center of mass and whether a gait is a walk or a run.},

Interpretation and analysis of the physics are straightforward; the walking cycle, its stability, and its sensi tivity to parameter variations are easily calculated. Experi ments with a test machine verify that the passive walking effect can be readily exploited in practice. The dynamics are most clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain.},

  abstract = {The plantigrade human foot rolls over the ground during each walking step, roughly analogous to a wheel. The center of pressure progresses on the ground like a wheel of radius 0.3 L (leg length). We examined the effect of varying foot curvature on the mechanics and energetics of walking. We controlled curvature by attaching rigid arc shapes of various radii to the bottoms of rigid boots restricting ankle motion. We measured mechanical work performed on the center of mass (COM), and net metabolic rate, in human subjects (N=10) walking with seven arc radii from 0.02-0.40 m. Simple models of dynamic walking predict that redirection of COM velocity requires step-to-step transition work, decreasing quadratically with arc radius. Metabolic cost would be expected to change in proportion to mechanical work. We measured the average rate of negative work performed on the COM, and found that it followed the trend well (r2=0.95), with 2.37 times as much work for small radii as for large. Net metabolic rate (subtracting quiet standing) also decreased with increasing arc radius to a minimum at 0.3 L, with a slight increase thereafter. Maximum net metabolic rate was 6.25 W kg(-1) (for small-radius arc feet), about 59\% greater than the minimum rate of 3.93 W kg(-1), which in turn was about 45\% greater than the rate in normal walking. Metabolic rate was fit reasonably well (r2=0.86) by a quadratic curve, but exceeded that expected from COM work for extreme arc sizes. Other factors appear to increase metabolic cost for walking on very small and very large arc feet. These factors may include effort expended to stabilize the joints (especially the knee) or to maintain balance. Rolling feet with curvature 0.3 L appear energetically advantageous for plantigrade walking, partially due to decreased work for step-to-step transitions.},

Our approach took advantage of the inverted pendulum-like behavior of the stance leg during walking to identify a new method for dividing up walking into individual stride cycles and estimating the initial conditions for the direct integration of the accelerometer and gyroscope signals. To test its accuracy, we compared speed estimates to known values during walking overground and on a treadmill. The speed estimation method worked well across treadmill speeds and slopes yielding a root mean square speed estimation error of only 7\%. It also worked well during overground walking with a 4\% error in the estimated travel distance. This accuracy is comparable to that achieved from foot-mounted sensors, providing an alternative in sensor positioning for walking speed estimation. Shank mounted sensors may be of great benefit for estimating speed in walking with abnormal foot motion and for the embedded control of knee-mounted devices such as prostheses and energy harvesters.},

We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- {\textbar}{\textbar}},

  abstract = {In daily life, a person’s gait—an important marker for his/her health status—is usually assessed using inertial sensors fixed to lower limbs or trunk. Such sensor locations are not well suited for continuous and long duration measurements. A better location would be the wrist but with the drawback of the presence of perturbative movements independent of walking. The aim of this study was to devise and validate an algorithm able to accurately estimate walking cadence and speed for daily life walking in various environments based on acceleration measured at the wrist. To this end, a cadence likelihood measure was designed, automatically filtering out perturbative movements and amplifying the periodic wrist movement characteristic of walking. Speed was estimated using a piecewise linear model. The algorithm was validated for outdoor walking in various and challenging environments (e.g., trail, uphill, downhill). Cadence and speed were successfully estimated for all conditions. Overall median (interquartile range) relative errors were −0.13\% (−1.72 2.04\%) for instantaneous cadence and −0.67\% (−6.52 6.23\%) for instantaneous speed. The performance was comparable to existing algorithms for trunk- or lower limb-fixed sensors. The algorithm’s low complexity would also allow a real-time implementation in a watch.},

  abstract   = {Using smartphones for indoor motion trajectory tracing has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, which offers great potential to support a broad spectrum of applications in indoor environment, including elder care, business analysis, and navigation. Yet most existing approaches only work for certain pedestrian's motion modes or smartphone's carrying patterns, which lack the robustness and adaptability to general scenarios. In this paper, we propose SmartMTra, a comprehensive, robust, and accurate solution for indoor motion trajectory tracing based on smartphone's built-in inertial sensors. Through analyzing the data from inertial sensors, we extract a set of features that are found to be highly related to human's physical activities, which can help to identify motion mode and phone's carrying pattern through a decomposition model. After that, SmartMTra utilizes the pedestrian dead reckoning technique, which involves estimating step counts, step-length, and heading direction, to achieve accurate trajectory tracing. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of SmartMTra in a campus building, and the results demonstrate the robustness of SmartMTra in various scenarios, as well as the superiority of SmartMTra over the state-of-the-art solutions.},

This motion model requires a calibration procedure that can be done either on a known distance or on a constant speed period. The protocol includes walking and running speeds between 1.8km/h and 19.8km/h. Preliminary results based on eleven subjects are characterized by unbiased estimations with 2nd and 3rd quartiles of the relative error dispersion in the interval ±5\%.

  abstract  = {Location estimation and navigation, especially on smartphones has shown great progress in the past decade due to its low cost and ability to work without additional infrastructure. However, a challenge is the positioning, both in terms of step detection, step length approximation as well as heading estimation, which must be accurate and robust, even when the use of the device is varied in terms of placement or orientation. In this paper, we propose a scheme for retrieving relevant information to detect steps and to estimate the correct step length from raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This approach uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM-RNNs). Designed to take contextual information into account, the network can process data gathered from different positions, resulting in a system, which is invariant with respect to transformation and distortions of the input patterns. An experimental evaluation on a dataset produced from 10 individuals demonstrates that this new approach achieves significant improvements over previous attempts and increase the current state-of-the-art results even in the presence of variations and degradations. We achieved a mean classification rate of 98.5\% and a standard deviation of 0.70 for 10000 different test sequences and an average error of 1.45\% regarding the step length. Thus is the best result on the task gathered in the experiments compared with competing techniques.},

  abstract   = {Acquiring instant walking distance is desirable in indoor localization and map construction. However, due to the blackout of Global Positioning System (GPS) in indoor settings, to accurately estimate the indoor walking distance with minimum hardware requirement is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a lightweight scheme, called DiSen, to range the instant walking distance of smartphone users. After analysing the extensive walking trace data, we find that people have rather consistent walking behaviour even though they may change their walking speeds in different situations. Furthermore, the relationship between stride length and step frequency while walking can be well estimated using non-linear sigmoid model. Inspired by such insights, we first design a stride segmenting method to obtain reliable and accurate step frequency information from raw accelerometer readings. We then train a sigmoid model using acceleration and GPS information collected when a user walks in outdoor conditions and finally apply the model to indoor walking distance ranging. Real-world experiment results show that, in different walking speeds, DiSen can reach average distance estimation accuracy of 96\%.},

  abstract  = {Ultimately there will be times when all enhancements to GPS signal reception fail. In these situations a number of approaches to GPS denied navigation have been proposed. These often make use of supplemental radio frequency signals, some of which actually require setting up a local RF infrastructure. The personal navigation aid proposed here, although utilizing a radio frequency signal, is intended to be self contained and of low power. It consists of a micromechanical IMU on each boot combined with a series of foot-to-foot range measurements. A frequency generator at the waist sends a signal down one leg to a transmitting antenna on one boot. The RF signal is received on the other boot and sent to the waist pack thereby closing the loop. A detector at the waist measures phase change and thus measures the changing distance between the two feet. Our analysis shows that this scalar distance change measurement used in conjunction with micro-mechanical inertial instruments on each foot and combined with "zero-velocity updates" at each (or most) foot falls enables quite accurate personal navigation. The performance of an unaided inertial navigation system based on modest quality micromechanical instruments is truly poor. Our analysis shows a 2.5 km error in each horizontal direction after walking in a straight line for 10 minutes (2900 ft). The addition of zero velocity updates reduces this error to 60 m predominantly in the cross range axis. The addition of the foot-to-foot range change measurement reduces this value by another two orders of magnitude, to 0.6 m This measurement concept is a big step toward an accu-rate self-contained personal navigation system It is not dependent on external signals or ambient light. The RF could be very low power (it only has to extend over the foot-to-foot distance). As such it should be relatively covert compared to a Doppler radar or acoustic Doppler device. There is a price to pay in terms of body mounted hardware, but this could be mitigated by the push toward instrumented clothing.},

Progress in new technologies has led the development of a series of devices and techniques which allow for objective evaluation, making measurements more efficient and effective and providing specialists with reliable information. Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40\% of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5\% presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5\% corresponded to other wearable systems. An increasing number of research works demonstrate that various parameters such as precision, conformability, usability or transportability have indicated that the portable systems based on body sensors are promising methods for gait analysis.},

              OBJECTIVES: To determine estimates of the typical times per day spent outdoors during weekdays, weekends and holidays during a summer season.
              METHODS: A number of published studies giving data on the time per day spent outdoors by people were reviewed and a meta-analysis performed. From these data summary estimates of the average time per day outdoors were extracted.
              RESULTS: Time spent per day outdoors during weekdays and weekends is positively skewed, with a normal distribution of times outdoors during holidays. The median times per day outdoors during weekdays and weekends gave pooled estimates of 1·04 and 1·64 h, respectively. Corresponding values for the pooled estimates of mean times outdoors during these two periods were 1·43 and 2·38 h. The mean time per day outdoors during holiday exposure is 5-6 h.
              CONCLUSIONS: Summer-long distribution of times spent outdoors on a daily basis exhibits a highly skewed nature that highlights the difference between our adventitious and recreational exposure. Over the course of a summer season, when people are outside, they spend on average of 1-2 h per day outdoors.},

However, its acceptability by study participants is unclear. Our objective is to assess factors associated with non-consent to a wrist-mounted accelerometer in older adults. Methods Data are from 4880 Whitehall II study participants (1328 women, age range = 60–83), requested to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer 24 h every day for 9 days in 2012/13. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related factors were assessed by questionnaire and weight, height, blood pressure, cognitive and motor function were measured during a clinical examination. Results 210 participants had contraindications and 388 (8.3\%) of the remaining 4670 participants did not consent. Women, participants reporting less physical activity and less favorable general health were more likely not to consent. Among the clinical measures, cognitive impairment (Odds Ratio = 2.21, 95\% confidence interval: 1.22–4.00) and slow walking speed (Odds Ratio = 1.38, 95\% confidence interval: 1.02–1.86) were associated with higher odds of non-consent. Conclusions The rate of non-consent in our study of older adults was low. However, key markers of poor health at older ages were associated with non-consent, suggesting some selection bias in the accelerometer data.},

Due to the absence of global positioning system signal in indoor environments, many other signals and sensors have been proposed for indoor usage. However, the challenging scenarios faced by emergency responders imply explicit restrictions and requirements on the design of an IPS, making the use of some technologies, techniques, and methods inadequate on these scenarios. This survey identifies the specific requirements of an IPS for emergency responders and provides a tutorial coverage of the localization techniques and methods, highlighting the pros and cons of their use. Then, the existing IPSs specifically developed for emergency scenarios are reviewed and compared with a focus on the design choices, requirements, and additional features.

  abstract  = {Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor positioning systems (IPSs) use wireless technologies (including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and ultra-wide band (UWB)) to estimate the location of persons in areas where no Global Positioning System (GPS) reception is available, for example in indoor stadiums or sports halls. Of the above-mentioned forms of radio frequency (RF) technology, UWB is considered one of the most accurate approaches because it can provide positioning estimates with centimeter-level accuracy. However, it is not yet known whether UWB can also offer such accurate position estimates during strenuous dynamic activities in which moves are characterized by fast changes in direction and velocity. To answer this question, this paper investigates the capabilities of UWB indoor localization systems for tracking athletes during their complex (and most of the time unpredictable) movements. To this end, we analyze the impact of on-body tag placement locations and human movement patterns on localization accuracy and communication reliability. Moreover, two localization algorithms (particle filter and Kalman filter) with different optimizations (bias removal, non-line-of-sight (NLoS) detection, and path determination) are implemented. It is shown that although the optimal choice of optimization depends on the type of movement patterns, some of the improvements can reduce the localization error by up to 31\%. Overall, depending on the selected optimization and on-body tag placement, our algorithms show good results in terms of positioning accuracy, with average errors in position estimates of 20 cm. This makes UWB a suitable approach for tracking dynamic athletic activities.},

The aim of this study was to undertake a quality assessment on the use of a commercial Ultra-Wide Band positioning system for the tracking of athletes during indoor wheelchair court sports. Several aspects have been investigated including system set-up, calibration, sensor positioning, determination of sport performance indicators and quality assessment of the output. With a simple set-up procedure, it has been demonstrated that athletes tracking can be
              achieved with an average horizontal positioning error of 0.37 m (s = 6 0.24 m). The distance covered can be computed after data processing with an error below 0.5\% of the course length. It has also been demonstrated that the tag update rate and the number of wheelchairs on the court do not affect significantly the positioning quality; however, for highly dynamic movement tracking, higher rates are recommended for a finer dynamic recording.},

Since many site accidents occur when workers are struck by moving equipment or enter hazard-prone areas, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the UWB RTLS in estimating the location of dynamic resources on construction sites. In this paper, the effects of variables, such as “speed” and “heading”, on the accuracy of the estimated location of dynamic tags are investigated. It is shown that the accuracy is inversely proportionate to the speed of the tag, the number of tags being tracked and the complexity of the path on which the tag is moving. A novel approach to defining “danger zones” on construction sites is also proposed through which the feasibility of using static tags to define the boundaries of forbidden areas on site is validated. The findings of this study indicate the applicability of UWB in locating dynamic resources on construction sites.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a footstep based indoor location system. The traditional Japanese GETA sandals are equipped with force, ultrasonic, orientation, RFID sensors and an accelerometer to produce a wearable location tracking system that demand little infrastructure in the deployed environment. In its basic form, a user simply puts on GETA sandals to enable tracking of his/her locations relative to a starting point (e.g., a building entrance), making it easy for deployment everywhere. The footstep location system is based on dead-reckoning, which works by measuring and tracking displacement vectors along a trail of footsteps. Each displacement vector is formed by drawing a line between each pair of footsteps, and the position of a user can be calculated by summing up the current and all previous displacement vectors. Unlike most existing indoor location systems, the footstep based method does not suffer from problems with obstacles, multi-path effects, signal noises, signal interferences, and dead spots. There are two technical challenges in the proposed design: (1) location error accumulates over distance traveled, and (2) displacement measurements are sporadic during stair climbing. The first problem is addressed by a light RFID infrastructure, while the second problem is remedied by incorporating an accelerometer into the system. Experiments on GETA prototype are conducted to evaluate the positional accuracy of our system.},

Sensor fusion is accomplished via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) design which simultaneously estimates the IMU sensors' systematic errors and corrects the positioning errors. Fault detection, identification, and isolation are built into the EKF design to prevent the corrupted UWB sensor measurement data due to obstructions, multi-path and other interferences from degrading the positioning performance. General formulation of an IPS using IMU for both pure inertial and Kalman filter aided modes of operation using UWB sensor data is given in the paper for tracking a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) platform motion. The derivations of an 8-state EKF design are detailed in the paper for a 3 DOF (two translational and one angular motions) platform planar motion, where data from a 9-axis Motion Tracking device, MPU-9250, and four UWB radio sensor devices, DWM1000, are used. A Matlab-based simulation model is developed and built to assess the proposed IPS performance along with their performance sensitivities to platform motion profiles, UWB/inertial sensor errors, and filter update rates. With specific motion profiles, computer simulation results indicate that more than 100\% positioning performance improvement over the UWB sensor-based positioning solution along can be obtained through the proposed sensor fusion solution. A laboratory test bed for a 3 DOF motion platform is designed, built, and tested to validate the proposed IPS performance. The IPS performance obtained from actual laboratory tests correlated very well with the simulation results.},

  abstract   = {Some location-aware use cases imply that a person desires to find an object relative to his position. This is the case of museum visits or any indoors/outdoors activity where the objects of interest are not geo-referenced or even can move with time. For these use cases, a user does not need an absolute localization, but a relative information consisting of the range to the object and the heading angle between that object and the user's moving direction. In this paper we study two different radio technologies for finding an object of interest: Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Range and orientation estimation performance is studied when using just the distance or the Received-Signal-Strength (RSS) provided by UWB and BLE systems, respectively. Both approaches are combined with Pedestrian Dead-reckoning (PDR) estimation in order to analyze the benefits that PDR information provides. For completeness we compare the cases where only one tag is fixed to the object to locate (the simpler and more flexible case) with the more ideal case where several geo-referenced objects of interest, each one with a tag, jointly cooperate to improve the relative location to one of the objects of interest (in both cases the user carries a mobile phone with BLE 4.0 or UWB radio). The UWB ranging radio, not common in most smartphones, but very accurate, is used as our reference to define the best achievable performance goal, in order to compare with BLE RSS-based performance. We demonstrate that the common BLE low ranging-accuracy technology combined with smartphone-based PDR estimation is capable, after some initial user's walking, of finding with decent range and heading accuracy the objects of interest in a museum-like set-up.},

The research activities on this topic concentrate on the development of new positioning solutions that are tested in specific environments under their own evaluation metrics. To explore the real positioning quality of smartphone-based solutions and their capabilities for seamlessly adapting to different scenarios, it is needed to find fair evaluation frameworks. The design of competitions using extensive pre-recorded datasets is a valid way to generate open data for comparing the different solutions created by research teams. In this paper, we discuss the details of the 2017 IPIN indoor localization competition, the different datasets created, the teams participating in the event, and the results they obtained. We compare these results with other competition-based approaches (Microsoft and Perf-loc) and on-line evaluation web sites. The lessons learned by organising these competitions and the benefits for the community are addressed along the paper. Our analysis paves the way for future developments on the standardization of evaluations and for creating a widely-adopted benchmark strategy for researchers and companies in the field.},

Among the different available wearable devices, wrist-worn devices, such as smartwatches, have great potential due to their featuring more and more sensors and their convenience for the users. However, the low number of wrist-worn PDR systems proposed in the scientific literature reveals the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the position from the upper limbs. Before starting to design new algorithms for improving wrist-worn PDRs, it was considered necessary to make a deep analysis of the characteristics of the different signals generated in a wrist-worn sensor when a person walks, and identify how they affect the implementation of an inertial PDR system for that body location. After this analysis task, it seems feasible to implement wrist-worn PDR systems thanks to the presence of clear step/stride patterns in the signals coming from different types of wrist-worn sensors. However, these patterns show a non-negligible variability dependent on the different motion modes, walking speed and the way each user moves their upper limbs while walking, indicating that adaptive algorithms and prior calibration stages are necessary.},

  abstract   = {Smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and ad-hoc wearable devices are being increasingly used to monitor human activities. Data acquired by the hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available, would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques. Nowadays, there are only a few publicly available data sets, which often contain samples from subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack specific information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL performed, the age, the gender, and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different classification tasks: fall vs. no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and falls. For each classification task, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation (i.e., including samples from all the subjects in both the training and the test dataset) and a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (i.e., the test data include the samples of a subject only, and the training data, the samples of all the other subjects). Regarding the classification tasks, the major findings can be summarized as follows: (i) it is quite easy to distinguish between falls and ADLs, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. Indeed, these classes of activities present quite different acceleration shapes that simplify the recognition task; (ii) on average, it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than between types of activities, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. This is due to the similarity between the acceleration shapes of different kinds of falls. On the contrary, ADLs acceleration shapes present differences except for a small group. Finally, the evaluation shows that the presence of samples of the same subject both in the training and in the test datasets, increases the performance of the classifiers regardless of the feature vector used. This happens because each human subject differs from other subjects in performing activities even if she shares with them the same physical characteristics.},

The ground-truth trajectory was obtained from a motion-capture system with eight high-speed tracking cameras (100 Hz). The dataset consists of 39 sequences that were recorded in an office environment and an industrial hall. The dataset covers a large variety of scenes and camera motions. We provide sequences for debugging with slow motions as well as longer trajectories with and without loop closures. Most sequences were recorded from a handheld Kinect with unconstrained 6-DOF motions but we also provide sequences from a Kinect mounted on a Pioneer 3 robot that was manually navigated through a cluttered indoor environment. To stimulate the comparison of different approaches, we provide automatic evaluation tools both for the evaluation of drift of visual odometry systems and the global pose error of SLAM systems. The benchmark website [1] contains all data, detailed descriptions of the scenes, specifications of the data formats, sample code, and evaluation tools.},

In a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, there was a statistically significant age-variability for gait speed and step length at normal and fast gait, but not for step frequency. In the step length parameter there was a significant interaction effect of age and sex at normal and fast gait. The reference data are considered valid in an indoor laboratory situation.},

  abstract   = {Background. Gait disorders, a highly prevalent condition in older adults, are associated with several adverse health consequences. Gait analysis allows qualitative and quantitative assessments of gait that improves the understanding of mechanisms of gait disorders and the choice of interventions. This manuscript aims 1) to give consensus guidance for clinical and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls in older adults aged 65 years and over, and 2) to provide reference values for spatiotemporal gait parameters based on the recorded footfalls in healthy older adults free of cognitive impairment and multi-morbidities. Methods. International experts working in a network of two different consortiums (i.e.; Biomathics and Canadian Gait Consortium) participated in this initiative. First, they identified items of standardized information following the usual procedure of formulation of consensus findings. Second, they merged databases including spatiotemporal gait assessments with GAITRite® system and clinical information from the “Gait, cOgnitiOn \& Decline” (GOOD) initiative and the Generation 100 (Gen 100) study. Only healthy - free of cognitive impairment and multi-morbidities (i.e.; ≤3 therapeutics taken daily) - participants aged 65 and older were selected. Age, sex, body mass index, mean values and coefficients of variation (CoV) of gait parameters were used for the analyses. Results. Standardized systematic assessment of three categories of items, which were demographics and clinical information, and gait characteristics (clinical and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls), were selected for the proposed guidelines. Two complementary sets of items were distinguished: a minimal data set and a full data set. In addition, a total of 954 participants (mean age 72.8 ± 4.8 years, 45.8\% women) were recruited to establish the reference values. Performance of spatiotemporal gait parameters based on the recorded footfalls declined with increasing age (mean values and CoV) and demonstrated sex differences (mean values only). Conclusions. Based on an international multicenter collaboration, we propose consensus guidelines for gait assessment and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls, and reference values for healthy older adults.},

Although there are a number of contributions related to the design of data fusion algorithms, the lack of details in raw measurements analysis has directly motivated this paper. This paper aims to record data from a variety of sensors (such as GNSS, IMU, magnetometer, barometer, tachometers, and Doppler radars) to evaluate train velocity and railway features (track slope, curve cant, and radius) extending previous works in the instrumentation and measurement field. The field test designed and concisely described in this paper presents several challenging environments, such as a tunnel, which can be used to analyze the candidate sensors limitations. In addition, a demonstration of a data fusion algorithm is presented to calculate train velocity based on measurements from the candidate sensors. The results obtained by an extended Kalman filter using GNSS and IMU are compared with velocity recorded by tachometers and Doppler radars, which is considered to be the reference value. The calculated velocity by IMU and GNSS when both sensors measurements are available presents an absolute error in velocity lower than 2 km/h in more than 90\% of test duration. Finally, railway features (curve radius, cant, and slope) are calculated and analyzed according to train and railway dynamics.},

  abstract  = {In personal navigation, pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) systems based on low-cost self-contained sensors exploit the kinematics of human walking, and are well suited for indoor use and in urban canyons where GPS signals are degraded or not available. Considering the electromyography (EMG), which measures electrical potentials generated by muscle contractions from human body, would reflect the muscle activities during human locomotion, this kind of biomedical signal can be utilized to capture human walking characteristics in PDR. The work presented in this paper is the consecutive step of our pilot studies in further developing a novel and robust PDR solution using wearable EMG sensors to measure walking steps. Our PDR solution includes the EMG-based activity classification, step occurrence detection, and step length estimation, as well as the position calculation with the heading from a two-axis digital compass. To avoid step misdetection, two kinds of activities: walking normally and standing still, are classified via the hidden Markov model classifier fed by the sample entropy features extracted from the raw EMG data. Some EMG statistical parameters are also investigated to establish the optimized step length model. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method, several field tests were conducted by a male tester in two experimental sessions, to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the method using EMG to measure walking steps. Furthermore, the results indicate the performance of the PDR solution is comparable to that of the GPS under open-sky environments.},

We make use of two foot-mounted INS, one on each foot, which are aided with zero-velocity detectors. A novel algorithm is proposed in order to reduce the systematic heading drift. The proposed algorithm is based on the idea that the separation between the two feet at any given instance must always lie within a sphere of radius equal to the maximum possible spatial separation between the two feet. A Kalman filter, getting one measurement update and two observation updates is used in this algorithm.},

  abstract  = {The localization of persons in indoor environments is nowadays an open problem. There are partial solutions based on the deployment of a network of sensors (Local Positioning Systems or LPS). Other solutions only require the installation of an inertial sensor on the person’s body (Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning or PDR). PDR solutions integrate the signals coming from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which usually contains 3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes. The main problem of PDR is the accumulation of positioning errors due to the drift caused by the noise in the sensors. This paper presents a PDR solution that incorporates a drift correction method based on detecting the access ramps usually found in buildings. The ramp correction method is implemented over a PDR framework that uses an Inertial Navigation algorithm (INS) and an IMU attached to the person’s foot. Unlike other approaches that use external sensors to correct the drift error, we only use one IMU on the foot. To detect a ramp, the slope of the terrain on which the user is walking, and the change in height sensed when moving forward, are estimated from the IMU. After detection, the ramp is checked for association with one of the existing in a database. For each associated ramp, a position correction is fed into the Kalman Filter in order to refine the INS-PDR solution. Drift-free localization is achieved with positioning errors below 2 meters for 1,000-meter-long routes in a building with a few ramps.},

  abstract  = {An accurate orientation is crucial to a satisfactory position in pedestrian navigation. The orientation estimation, however, is greatly affected by errors like the biases of gyroscopes. In order to minimize the error in the orientation, the biases of gyroscopes must be estimated and subtracted. In the state of the art it has been proposed, but not proved, that the estimation of the biases can be accomplished using magnetic field measurements. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of using magnetic field measurements to estimate the biases of medium-cost micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS) gyroscopes. We carry out the evaluation with experiments that cover both, quasi-error-free turn rate and magnetic measurements and medium-cost MEMS turn rate and magnetic measurements. The impact of different homogeneous magnetic field distributions and magnetically perturbed environments is analyzed. Additionally, the effect of the successful biases subtraction on the orientation and the estimated trajectory is detailed. Our results show that the use of magnetic field measurements is beneficial to the correct biases estimation. Further, we show that different magnetic field distributions affect differently the biases estimation process. Moreover, the biases are likewise correctly estimated under perturbed magnetic fields. However, for indoor and urban scenarios the biases estimation process is very slow.},

The results show a strong tendency by gender, with females using bags and males using trouser pockets to place their mobile phones. Comments from participants suggested users did not place the phone wherever available, but rather considered many aspects, such as the convenience, tolerance to multiple postures, risk of theft, comfort, or impact to their appearance.

Motion tracking can be achieved using such devices, and is important for various applications such as navigation, search and rescue, health monitoring, and quality of life-style assessment. Step detection is a crucial task that affects the accuracy and quality of such applications. In this paper, a new step detection technique is proposed, which can be used for step counting and activity monitoring for health applications as well as part of a Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) system. Inertial and Magnetic sensors measurements are analyzed and fused for detecting steps under varying step modes and device pose combinations using a free-moving handheld device (smartphone). Unlike most of the state of the art research in the field, the proposed technique does not require a classifier, and adaptively tunes the filters and thresholds used without the need for presets while accomplishing the task in a real-time operation manner. Testing shows that the proposed technique successfully detects steps under varying motion speeds and device use cases with an average performance of 99.6\%, and outperforms some of the state of the art techniques that rely on classifiers and commercial wristband products.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, indoor localization systems have been the object of significant research activity and of growing interest for their great expected social impact and their impressive business potential. Application areas include tracking and navigation, activity monitoring, personalized advertising, Active and Assisted Living (AAL), traceability, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and Home-land Security. In spite of the numerous research advances and the great industrial interest, no canned solutions have yet been defined. The diversity and heterogeneity of applications, scenarios, sensor and user requirements, make it difficult to create uniform solutions. From that diverse reality, a main problem is derived that consists in the lack of a consensus both in terms of the metrics and the procedures used to measure the performance of the different indoor localization and navigation proposals. This paper introduces the general lines of the EvAAL benchmarking framework, which is aimed at a fair comparison of indoor positioning systems through a challenging competition under complex, realistic conditions. To evaluate the framework capabilities, we show how it was used in the 2016 Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) Competition. The 2016 IPIN competition considered three different scenario dimensions, with a variety of use cases: (1) pedestrian versus robotic navigation, (2) smartphones versus custom hardware usage and (3) real-time positioning versus off-line post-processing. A total of four competition tracks were evaluated under the same EvAAL benchmark framework in order to validate its potential to become a standard for evaluating indoor localization solutions. The experience gained during the competition and feedback from track organizers and competitors showed that the EvAAL framework is flexible enough to successfully fit the very different tracks and appears adequate to compare indoor positioning systems.},

  abstract  = {Medium accuracy inertial systems of the 1 nautical mile per hour class, enjoyed significant acceptance in the market for land survey systems in the early 1970's-prior to the introduction of GPS. This occurred because such systems could be implemented with software that capitalized on “zero velocity updates” (ZUPTS) which enabled the resultant system to achieve real-time navigation accuracies of a few meters over several hours of operation. “ZUPTS” are realized by simply bringing a land vehicle to a stop or, in the case of a helicopter, by hovering across a fixed point on the ground. Those initial inertial survey systems were large, heavy, expensive and required substantial power. Since the technology has changed dramatically, these systems have become highly suitable as the core of the navigation and control suite for small submersibles. The paper will discuss and illustrate the trend in inertial technology, from that of gimbaled spinning wheel gyro based systems initially employed for surveying, to the ring laser gyro based systems available today and the next generation of systems employing fiber optic gyros. Performance obtainable with these medium grade inertial systems will also be presented as a function of the quality of zero velocity updates. Realization of zero velocity updates by different means will also be a topic of discussion},

The magnetometers in these setups are negatively affected by external magnetic interferences induced by various sources. Therefore, expensive, heavy and lengthy protective nonmagnetic collars need to be installed. Fiber-optic gyroscopes (FOGs) in an inertial navigation setup have been proposed as an alternative to magnetometer-based downhole surveying. The present study explored the feasibility of utilizing a FOG-based tactical-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) as a complete surveying sensor for measurement-while-drilling (MWD) processes downhole. Alignment and real-time navigation under laboratory conditions were demonstrated. Analysis of vibrations and temperature as possible factors limiting the accuracy of the navigation process was performed. Severe vibration effects were reduced using software techniques, and a shock-absorbing housing was suggested. The temperature range of the IMU is limited by the optical components of the device, but dynamic temperature changes within this range did not present a major problem. A downhole sub design demonstrated that the actual integration of the IMU requires only minor changes in the presently used drilling tools. The utilization of a tactical-grade IMU eliminates the necessity of nonmagnetic collars, which results in lower costs and improved accuracy.},

  abstract = {The link between mental representation (MREP) structures and motor performance has been evidenced for a great variety of movement skills, but not for the human gait. Therefore the present study sought to investigate the cognitive memory structures underlying the human gait in young and older adults. In a first experiment, gait parameters at comfortable gait speed (OptoGait) were compared with gait-specific MREPs (structural dimensional analysis of MREP; SDA-M) in 36 young adults. Participants were divided into a slow- and fast-walking group. The proven relationship between gait speed and executive functions such as working memory led to the hypothesis that gait pattern and MREP differ between slow- and fast-walking adults. In a second experiment, gait performance and MREPs were compared between 24 young (27.9 years) and 24 elderly (60.1 years) participants. As age-related declines in gait performance occur from the seventh decade of life onward, we hypothesized that gait parameters would not be affected until the age of 60 years accompanied by unchanged MREP. Data of experiment one revealed that gait parameters and MREPs differed significantly between slow and fast walkers. Notably, eleven previously incurred musculoskeletal injuries were documented for the slow walkers but only two injuries and one disorder for fast walkers. Experiment two revealed no age-related differences in gait parameters or MREPs between healthy young and older adults. In conclusion, the differences in gait parameters associated with lower comfortable gait speeds are reflected by differences in MREPs, whereby SDA-M data indicate that the single limb support phase may serve as a critical functional period. These differences probably resulted from previously incurred musculoskeletal injuries. Our data further indicate that the human gait and its MREP are stable until the age of 60. SDA-M may be considered as a valuable clinical tool for diagnosis of gait abnormalities and monitoring of therapeutic effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such as global positioning system (GPS), has been widely used for vehicular and outdoor navigation. Accuracy is one, among many, of the advantages of using GNSS in the open sky. However, GNSS finds difficulty in achieving similar results in portable navigation, where users spend most of their time indoors or in urban canyons, places where GNSS signals suffer from multipath error or signal blockage. One of the most common solutions for providing location services in such challenging environments is integrating GNSS with inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. However, the arbitrary orientation of the portable device can present a more difficult challenge when using inertial sensors for portable navigation. In order to obtain a navigation solution using inertial sensors, an accurate heading estimation is required. Resolving the heading misalignment angle between the portable navigation device and the moving platform, such as using the device while walking or in a vehicle while driving, is critical to obtaining an accurate heading estimation. We present a solution for resolving the misalignment between the portable device and the moving platform, which exploits multiple portable devices like smartphones or tablets and/or smart wearable devices such as smart watches, smart glasses, and/or smart fitness and activity trackers/monitors. Several real field test experiments using portable devices were conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method. Results show how a portable navigation solution can be improved by further enhancing misalignment estimation.},

A new era of highly accurate ubiquitous location-awareness is on the horizon, enabled by a paradigm of cooperation between nodes. In this paper, we give an overview of cooperative localization approaches and apply them to ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) wireless networks. UWB transmission technology is particularly attractive for short- to medium-range localization, especially in GPS-denied environments: wide transmission bandwidths enable robust communication in dense multipath scenarios, and the ability to resolve subnanosecond delays results in centimeter-level distance resolution. We will describe several cooperative localization algorithms and quantify their performance, based on realistic UWB ranging models developed through an extensive measurement campaign using FCC-compliant UWB radios. We will also present a powerful localization algorithm by mapping a graphical model for statistical inference onto the network topology, which results in a net-factor graph, and by developing a suitable net-message passing schedule. The resulting algorithm (SPAWN) is fully distributed, can cope with a wide variety of scenarios, and requires little communication overhead to achieve accurate and robust localization.},

  abstract   = {Inertial sensors are included in most of the current smart devices and many researchers have identified their ability to be used for analyzing different parameters of human behavior. Among them, the pedestrian’s step length provides very useful information for different applications, such as pedestrian dead reckoning positioning or gait analysis. During the last three decades, many step length estimation methods using inertial sensors have been proposed; however, there is no specific review work that reflects the current state of the art. In this paper, we will conduct a systematic and complete review that covers the whole workflow of tasks involved in the design, test, and evaluation of step length estimation methods based on inertial sensors. The main conclusion drawn from this review is that the lack of public data sets and standard methodologies to guide testing and evaluation makes it difficult to compare the different methods in a fair and robust way. Some reflections on how to move forward on this direction have been presented.},

  abstract  = {Documenting visual observations and other data taken during field missions such as inspections, complementary accesses and design information verification is a time-consuming process which requires considerable effort from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in the field. To streamline their work in the field, IAEA inspectors would benefit from being able to position themselves and navigate inside vast and complex sites. Automated positioning of the inspector will result in more accurate and complete documentation of the measurements and data that they collect. While outdoor positioning using GPS is a mature technology, an autonomous system providing ubiquitous positioning without relying on any infrastructure is still an emerging technology. This paper presents the results of the Technology Evaluation Workshop that was conducted in 2014 by the Department of Safeguards of the IAEA to assess the readiness level of existing technologies, identify gaps, and validate the identified operational needs. Potential implementation of the technology is envisioned, and the paper highlights how they could benefit the efficiency of IAEA safeguards activities in the field and at Headquarters.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this paper is to compare two inertial navigation systems in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses as well as to propose new fusion algorithms for these systems. The goal of the fusion is to combine the best of both navigation systems in order to obtain an improved position estimation of the pedestrian. To that extent, the comparison starts with an analysis of the sensor parameters obtained with the Allan variance method. The comparison continues with the analysis of the odometries obtained with both pocket- and foot-mounted sensors. This is done by comparing the true positions of a set of ground truth points with the position estimated by the navigation systems. The analysis shows that the pocket-mounted system is reliable for step detection, whereas the foot-mounted system misses some stance phase periods. The advantage of the foot-mounted system is, for example, the good estimation of the distance. For completeness and based on the results, we propose several fusion techniques to improve the pedestrian's position estimation.},

  doi       = {10.1109/PLANS.2012.6236874},
  abstract  = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has been the state of the art in Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning for foot-mounted Inertial Measurements Units. However due to the non-linearity in the propagation of the orientation the EKF is not the optimal Bayesian filter. We propose the usage of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as the integration algorithm for the inertial measurements. The UKF improves the mean and covariance propagation needed for the Kalman filter. Although the UKF provides a better estimate of the orientation, with Zero velocity UPdaTes (ZUPT) measurements, the yaw and the bias in the gyroscope associated with it becomes unobserved and might generate errors in the positioning. We studied the changes in the magnetic field during the stance phase and their relationship with the turn rates to propose three measurements using the magnetometer signal that will be called Magnetic Angular Rate Updates (MARUs). The first measurement uses the change in the angle of the magnetic field in the horizontal plane to measure the change in the yaw and provides a simple measurement for the UKF implementation. The second measurement relates the change in the magnetic field vector to the turn rate and provides information on the bias of the gyroscope for an UKF. The last measurement uses a first order approximation to generate a linear relationship with the gyroscope bias and therefore it can be used in an EKF. Finally we proposed a metric for the reliability of the stance as a way to use the pre and post stance information but adjusting the covariance of the measurements gradually from swing to stance. These methods were tested on real and simulated signals and they have shown improvements over the original PDR algorithms.},

We use a finite state machine based step detection technique for precise localization. This approach is able to detect different stances of the foot with high accuracy. The FSM-based step detection technique precisely detect Zero Velocity Updates (ZUPTs). ZUPTs can be applied in time in the navigation filter and positively affect the grade of the navigation solution. The functionality of the step detection module in combination with a constraint, stochastic cloning (SC) Kalman filter are analyzed with real sensor data recorded with our personal navigation system. Even with ultra-low cost inertial sensors, this approach delivers a personal navigation system for precise positioning in indoor environments and outdoor areas.},
