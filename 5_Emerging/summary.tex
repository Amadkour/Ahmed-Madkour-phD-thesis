\section{Summary}
\label{sec:5_summary}
This section presents a robust framework for incremental learning in data streams with emerging new classes. It integrates the ADWIN algorithm for concept drift detection, K-means clustering, and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) within an ensemble stratified bagging approach. ADWIN enables rapid drift detection and adaptation to new classes, while GNB serves as the base classifier for enhanced performance. The ensemble stratified bagging method significantly improves predictive performance, adaptability, and scalability, ensuring real-time relevance by dynamically updating the model based on incoming data.
